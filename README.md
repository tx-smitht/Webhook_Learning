# Webhook_Learning
This is a tiny project I worked on to try to understand the concept of webhooks. I created a flask server that listens for an HTTP POST, much like a web app would. I then created a file that calls the URL of the flask webhook path, much like Stripe would when payment is confirmed or denied.
